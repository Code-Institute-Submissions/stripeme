# StripeMe

## Introduction


Stripe Me is an e-commerce and portfolio website about web-development and design services. This project is a Python-Django web application, backed by a Postgres and squlite3 database, and deployed via the Heroku PaaS. Stripe Me uses the Stripe Checkout API (in testing mode: not currently taking real card payments) and is a lightweight, responsive website designed with the Bootstrap Grid Systems.  
  
As you read this document, you will find my complete development process, from UX strategy to deployment.
