# StripeMe

## Introduction

Stripe Me is an e-commerce and portfolio website about web-development and design services. This project is a Python-Django web application, backed by a Postgres and squlite3 database, and deployed via the Heroku PaaS. Stripe Me uses the Stripe Checkout API (in testing mode: not currently taking real card payments) and is a lightweight, responsive website designed with the Bootstrap Grid Systems.

### User and Their Goals

Since Covid-19 became a global pandemic, many people around the world began to live through lockdowns. Many began to work from home; others lost their jobs. With uncertainty becoming a norm, we can't know when, or if, our societies will return to normal and what consequences the pandemic will leave behind.

Overall, Covid-19 has normalized remote work, and a significant part of our global population is looking for online alternatives for their income: either by creating a new online entrepreneurial project, or by improving the one already in place, or by transferring their main activity from a physical, local organization to an online shop.

For many people, including artists, artisans, small business owners or independent contractors this technological transition can be challenging and expensive, specially during these troubling times.

Stripe Me provides easy and straightforward web-development, graphic design and digital marketing consultancy services for English-speaking users around the world (payments in US dollar). This project gears towards freelancers, entrepreneurs, and small to medium business alike, leveraging their online inception and profits during pandemic crisis.

Here available services are already formatted and able to be personalized: they are presented with a starter model and options, and the user can customize their order in terms of color scheme, dimensions and content. Consultancy sessions are also available for user who wish to have a more professional and involved approach to their digital business development. By setting up basic formats and options that can be personalized, Stripe Me keeps prices affordable and delivery time optimized.
